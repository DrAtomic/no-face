# Description

this program finds a faces using dlib and creates an ellipse mask with a flesh tone over the persons face. its not very good as is. theres a few things that need to get done. 

# get the code

cd no-face
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# run the code

```
python src/detect_face.py
```

# example

![no-face](./data/screenshot.png)

## note
i intentionally pushed the landmarks data because i thought it was hard to find. when you google "dlib landmarks data set" you get a bunch of tutorials and none of them have the data set either.
